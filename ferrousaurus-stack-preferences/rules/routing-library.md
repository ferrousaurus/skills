## Routing Library

### Go-To

- **TanStack Router** — Fully type-safe routing with first-class TypeScript support, built-in search params validation, and seamless integration with the rest of the TanStack ecosystem (Start, Query, Form). Type-safe navigation catches routing errors at compile time.

### Acceptable

None.

### Unacceptable

- **React Router** — Lacks the type-safety guarantees of TanStack Router. Search params are untyped, route definitions lack compile-time validation, and it does not integrate with the TanStack ecosystem.
- **Next.js** — Next.js imposes a file-based routing convention and couples routing to its full-framework approach, conflicting with the stack's preference for composable, decoupled libraries. See also [ssr-library.md](./ssr-library.md).
